# Detroit Ledger Coding and Project Standards

At the Ledger, we work in the open on public-good projects. Our goal is to have our projects documented so that anyone with at least beginner programming knowledge should be able to get any project here running in significantly less than a day. 

## Assumptions

We assume that most people running these projects:
* have basic knowledge of the Unix environment and are familiar with the command line
* have basic knowledge of the project's language (javasacript, python)

We attempt to walk through or link to details on all other concepts where possible. 

## Basics 

**License**

Use the [MIT license](https://github.com/detroitledger/codestandards/blob/master/LICENSE). 

**Readme**

Include a readme that makes it easy for most people to get started with the project quickly. Use this template to get started. Here's a [gold-standard readme](https://github.com/nprapps/liveblog) for reference.

The readme should cover:

1. A few sentences about what the project does
2. Clear, short instructions on how to run the project and what the output should look like
3. Instructions on how anyone can install the project. Be explicit about additional steps and requirements (eg how to install dependencies and where to put configuration options). The instructions should work on OSX and unix-y environments; other platform support is a good bonus.  
4. Optional section for developer notes about code organization and common troubleshooting solutions.

# Code quality

**Javascript**
Use the eslint config file in this repo with `prettier` wherever feasible. 

**Python**

Use `virtualenv` and `[virtualenvwraper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)`. Start projects with the `--no-site-packages` flag to keep dependencies clean.

Follow [pep8 conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Please use a linter to ensure your code looks and works well -- we recommend [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/), which has packages for most major editors.
